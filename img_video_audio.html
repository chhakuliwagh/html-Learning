    <p> Flowers, also known as blooms or blossoms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. They are
        typically composed of four main parts: sepals, petals, stamens (male parts), and pistils (female parts). Flowers
        play a vital role in plant reproduction by facilitating the union of sperm and egg cells, leading to the
        development of seeds and fruits. They also contribute to the ecosystem by providing food and attracting
        pollinators. </p>

    <p>
        Flowers have a stalk (peduncle) and may have smaller stems (pedicels) for individual flowers in a cluster
        (inflorescence). The four main parts are typically arranged in circular levels on the receptacle.
