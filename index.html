     <h1>Dagdushet History</h1>
     <p>
        In 1896, a plague hit Pune. Dagdusheth Halwai's son's <b>absence saddened him. </b>After his son's death, Dagdusheth passed away within a few months, <strong>leaving his wife and wealth.</strong> To address this, their spiritual guru, <i>Shri Madhavnath Maharaj,</i> advised building the Shri Datta Temple in Dagdusheth's name. <em>Dagdusheth's wife, </em>following the guru's guidance,<u>decided to construct the Datta Mandir and had a second Lord </u> Ganesha idol crafted by sculptor Shri Naik.<mark>In 1897, the young people were</mark> given this idol to start celebrating the Ganpati Utsav. In 1952, businessmen and youths, including Tatyasaheb Godse and his colleagues Dattoba Chavan, Mamasaheb Rasane, Laxmanrao Jamdade, Gajanan Kedari, Navrtirao Raikar, Balkrishna Jamdade, Shankarao Suryavanshi and Kashinathrao Rasane, took over the festival until 1967. They collected donations and celebrated the Amrit Mahotsav. In 75 years, the idol's arm broke, leading to discussions about replacing it. The broken idol was meticulously repaired and now resides in Ganesh Mandir and Raman in Kondhwa Child Care Center of the Trust.
